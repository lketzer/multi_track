`multi_track``

This is not a full package yet! **Only preliminary** 
It serves as an addition to `platypos` and allows for a more clear way of evolving planets through multiple stellar evolutionary paths. <br>
It uses multiprocessing to speed up the calculations. <br>
There are also some funtions to read in all the results. <br>
